# gtfs-archives-not-hosted-elsewhere

Ideally [GTFS](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/README.md) archives are hosted at a stable URL on a server run by an authoritative source, like a transit agency or a civic group. But sometimes, the creators of these feed archives don't have the infrastructure necessary to host them. Mapzen's [Transitland](https://transit.land/) originally proposed hosting these on a Github repository which gives them stable URLs that won't change and can be linked in data commons like [OpenMobilityData](https://www.openmobilitydata.org).

## How to use a feed archive

To download one feed archive:

1. Navigate through the file listings at [https://github.com/openmobilitydata/gtfs-archives-not-hosted-elsewhere/tree/master](https://github.com/openmobilitydata/gtfs-archives-not-hosted-elsewhere/tree/master)
2. Click on a `.zip` archive in the listings.
3. Click the `Raw` button to download a copy of the archive

To view historical versions of a feed archive

1. Navigate through the file listings at https://github.com/openmobilitydata/gtfs-archives-not-hosted-elsewhere/tree/master
2. Click on a `.zip` archive in the listings.
3. Click the `History` button to view all changes made to the feed archive.

## How to submit a new or updated feed archive

E-mail the feed archive as an attachment to [hello@transit.land](mailto:hello@transit.land).

If the file is 7Mb or larger, please e-mail us without attaching the file. We'll send you alternative instructions for how to upload your file.

## How to remove a feed because it's actually hosted elsewhere

E-mail [hello@transit.land](mailto:hello@transit.land) with the name of the feed archive in this repository and information about its stable URL. Please include information about your affiliation: whether you work for a transit agency, are a part of a local civic group, or have another sort of interest in the feed in question.

## License

When known, we'll include a `.txt`, `.md`, or `.html` file with the same name as the feed archive that includes information on the feed's license and terms of use.
