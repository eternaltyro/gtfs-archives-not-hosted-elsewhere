# gtfs-archives-not-hosted-elsewhere

Sometimes, the creators of [GTFS](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/spec/en/README.md) feeds don't have the infrastructure necessary to host them. (Ideally, archives are hosted at a stable URL on a server run by an authoritative source, like a transit agency or a civic group.) [Transitland](https://transit.land/) and [OpenMobilityData](https://www.openmobilitydata.org) are working together to host these feeds on a Github repository which gives them stable URLs that can be used by their sites.

## How to download one of these feeds

To use this data, we recommend you access it at a data commons like [OpenMobilityData](https://www.openmobilitydata.org) or [Transitland](https://transit.land/), which make it easier to inspect them and review their history. 

## How to submit a new feed or update it:

E-mail the feed archive as an attachment to [unhostedfeed@openmobilitydata.org](mailto:unhostedfeed@openmobilitydata.org).

If the file is 7Mb or larger, please e-mail us without attaching the file. We'll send you alternative instructions for how to upload your file.

## How to remove a feed because it's now officially hosted elsewhere

E-mail [unhostedfeed@openmobilitydata.org](mailto:unhostedfeed@openmobilitydata.org) with the name of the feed archive in this repository and information about its stable URL. Please include information about your affiliation: whether you work for a transit agency, are a part of a local civic group, or have another sort of interest in the feed in question.

## License

When known, we'll include a `.txt`, `.md`, or `.html` file with the same name as the feed archive that includes information on the feed's license and terms of use.
